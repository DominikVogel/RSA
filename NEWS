# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.8.3

NEW FEATURES

- Two new models: onlyx (x + x^2) and onlyy (y + y^2). Also included in compare() and in compare(... , plot=TRUE)
- Arbitrary data points can be plotted in plotRSA - i.e., you can plot a fit with existing regression weights, and still plot raw data points. See plotRSA() --> points(data=???)
- plotRSA --> points(value="predict") now also works in interactive plots (type="i")
- The hull in plotRSA now is much smoother and lies on the surface (before, long connection lines cut through the surface)
- print.RSA now prints the regression coefficients including standardized beta weights, and can print summaries for a submodel: print(r1, model="RR")


IMPROVEMENTS

- Refactored plotRSA and plot.RSA - much cleaner now

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.8.2

- If outliers are removed, this is now printed as a warning (more salient)
- added parameter "out.mark" in the points parameter of plotRSA: If set to TRUE, outliers according to Bollen & Jackman (1980) are printed as a red X symbol. This option works regardless of whether the RSA function has set out.rm to TRUE or FALSE: 
	- If out.rm == TRUE (in RSA()) and out.mark == FALSE (in plotRSA()), the outlier is removed from the model and *not plotted* in plotRSA. 
	- If out.rm == TRUE (in RSA()) and out.mark == TRUE (in plotRSA()), the outlier is removed from the model but plotted and marked in plotRSA.
	- If out.rm == FALSE (in RSA()) and out.mark == FALSE (in plotRSA()), the outlier is not removed from the model and plotted as a normal point in plotRSA (but not marked as outlier). 
	- If out.rm == FALSE (in RSA()) and out.mark == TRUE (in plotRSA()), the outlier is not removed from the model, but plotted and marked in plotRSA.
	- Example syntax: plotRSA(r1, points=list(show=TRUE, out.mark=TRUE))

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.8.1

- minor changes in the demo data set (the outcome variable now is not standardized, but in the original metric)
- Fixed a bug in demoRSA()

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.8

NEW FEATURES

- replaced bootRSA and boot.CI functions by a unified interface: confint(). This is now standard R behavior. Confidence intervals can be extracted directly from the lavaan model, or bootstrapped. See ?confint
- New sanity check: false/implausible convergence of constrained models is detected and a warning is printed.

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

- changed parameters for points and contours in plotRSA: now is a list with subelements, e.g.: points=list(show=TRUE, color="red", jitter=.2)
- changed default for `points` in plotRSA to TRUE
- Changed demo data set - this now better serves it's didactic purpose.

IMPROVEMENTS

- General R 3.0.2 compatibility
- Improved non-linear constraints; now false convergences are more uncommon

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.7.4

New features:

- new parameter in plotRSA: `contour.highlight`. Provide a vector of values, which indicate contour lines that should be plotted in bold.

Improvements:

- Suppressed another (uncritical) lavaan warning: NaN in sqrt(b3 * b5).
- Improved modeltree plot: non-significant models (with R2.p > .05) are printed in gray

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.7.3

New features:

- new parameter in plotRSA: `points.value`. If set to "raw", the original response is splotted, if set to "predicted", the predicted value is plotted.
- new parameter in plotRSA: `jitter`. The amount of jitter of the raw data points (to avoid overplotting). For standardized predictors, values around .02 make sense.

Package structure:

- Moved plyr, gridExtra, and RColorBrewer into the Imports section

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.7.2

New features:

- Added a graphical model comparison: `plot(compare(r1))` (requires package qgraph)
- new parameter in plotRSA: `pal.range`. If set to "box", the color ramp in the 3d and contour plots is scaled to the zlim, if set to "surface" it is scaled to the range of the actual surface. If set to "box", different 3d surface plots can be compared along their color, as long as the zlim is the same for both.
- new parameter in plotRSA: `maxlines`. Plots the maximum X for a given Y and vice versa.

- New models:
	- added the "shifted rising ridge model" (SRR)
	- added the "shifted and rotated rising ridge model" (SRRR)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.7.1

New features:

- new option in `getPar`: "r2.adj"
- added the null model (= intercept-only model) to `RSA` and `compare` (the null model can also be plotted and only shows the flat intercept surface)

Bug fixes:

- Example lines now are < 100 characters in order to pass R CMD check


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.7

New features:

- Added the "rising ridge" model (label = "RR")
- Added a movie function `movieRSA`: Create rotating and surface changing videos of surface plots! (this function needs ffmpeg to be accessible from the command line. It works on Mac OS, not sure about Windows or Linux!)

Changes:

- The color ramp in the 3d and contour plots now is scaled to the zlim, not to the range of the actual surface (as before). That means: Different surface plots can be compared along their color, as long as the zlim is the same for both.
- Moved packages tkrplot and rgl into "Suggests"
- Renamed parameter "showSP" to "param" in the plotRSA function
- Renamed parameter "rot" to "rotation" and "label.rot" to "label.rotation" in plotRSA
- Changed default rotation of 2d plot (it's now more comparable with the contour plot)

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed minor bug in plotRSA if axes limits were not identical
- Suppress specific (unavoidable but irrelevant) warnings from lavaan


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.6.1

Removed German umlauts for proper compiling

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.6

New features:

- Added parameter "cubic" to RSA function. If set to TRUE, also a cubic surface is fitted, adding four new parameters to the equation: X^3, Y^3, XY^2, and X^2Y
- Added parameter "project" to plotRSA. If project=TRUE, all lines which are defines by parameter "axes" are projected onto the floor of the cube.
- plotRSA now can plot a convex hull around the data points (set hull=TRUE); both in type="3d" and type="contour"
- plotRSA now can plot the CI of the stationary point (set SP.CI=TRUE); only for type="contour"
- All surface parameters now are also calculated for IA and sqdiff models

Changes:

- Changed parameter name "showBorder" to "border"
- Changed parameter name "showContour" to "contour"


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# version 0.5.1

New features:

- Added parameter "surface" to plot.RSA. surface = "predict" (default) plots the predicted surface. This is the known behavior of the function. surface = "smooth" plots a 2d-smoothed surface of the raw data (employs the Tps function of the fields package).



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  version 0.4

- first "public" release on CRAN
- no known bugs


# Known Todos:
- axes labels in plot.RSA(type="3d") have the correct rotation for the default plot rotation, but they do not rotate with the plot.
